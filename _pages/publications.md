## **Survey: Diffusion Models in Recommendation Systems**
[[Arxiv Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10548) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/tingruew/DiffusionModels-In-RecSys)

As diffusion models demonstrate exceptional ability at handling complex data distributions, we examine its application in recommendation systems to model user-item interactions and comprehensively survey existing papers in this domain.
We propose a taxonomy to categorize based on the type of recommendation task and the specific objective, as shown below.

## **Survey: Multi-step LLM Math Reasoning**
[[Arxiv Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14333) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/tingruew/Feedback-based-Multi-step-LLM-Math-Reasoning)

With chain-of-thought enhancing the LLM performance through multi-step reasoning, models try to integrate this multi-step process within itself. We study how stepwise feedback faciliates this in existing papers with a focus on mathemtics due to its logical nature and the large volume of research in the field, and we propose a taxonomy below.
