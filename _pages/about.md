### Welcome to my page! 

I'm a current PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at Santa Clara Unviersity.

Besides academics, I enjoy studying human nature, looking at life through probability and statistics, and combining both perspectives.

Feel free to check out my research page and blog posts for more information.
